# Inversion-model
Hybrid probabilistic inversion for mixed discrete–continuous subsurface parameters using joint seismic (Vp, Vs) and electrical conductivity:
coarse-grid screening → local MC → KDE posterior → HPR-based discrete inference.

What this repo does?

Uses a continuous-first, discrete-second workflow to reduce error propagation from early misclassification and to handle multi-modal posteriors.
